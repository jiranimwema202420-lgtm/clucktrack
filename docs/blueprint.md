## Core Features:

- Automated Data Collection: Collect and store real-time data from farm equipment (temperature sensors, feeders, water dispensers).
- Predictive Health Alerts: Employ a predictive AI model to forecast potential health issues and send preemptive alerts based on historical data.
- Automated Feed Optimization Tool: Use an AI tool to analyze consumption patterns and nutrient requirements, automatically adjusting feed mix to maximize growth and health.
- Inventory Management: Track poultry inventory, including additions (chicks) and subtractions (sales, losses), to optimize stocking density.
- Environmental Control Interface: Allow users to view and adjust environmental controls (temperature, humidity) remotely to maintain optimal conditions.
- Report Generation: Automatically generate reports on key performance indicators (KPIs) like feed conversion ratio, mortality rate, and average weight gain.
- User Roles and Permissions: Enable multiple user roles (admin, worker, vet) with tiered permissions to manage farm operations securely.

- Dashboard layout providing a high-level overview of all key metrics.
- Subtle transitions for data updates to give a dynamic and responsive feel.
